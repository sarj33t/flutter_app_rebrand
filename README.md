# Flutter App Rebrand

A Flutter app rebrand involves updating the appâ€™s visual identity, such as changing the package name, launcher icon, alongside any logos or assets. It ensures consistency with the new branding while maintaining the core functionality.

## What It does?
- [x] Updates AndroidManifest.xml, build.gradle and MainActivity in both Java and Kotlin
- [x] Moves MainActivity to the new package directory structure and deletes old one
- [x] Generate & updates old ic_launcher icons with new ones
- [x] Updates Product Bundle Identifier in iOS (Runner.xcodeproj)
- [x] Generate & updates AppIcons and ImageSets

## How to Use?

Add Flutter App Rebrand to your `pubspec.yaml` in `dev_dependencies:` section. 
```yaml
dev_dependencies: 
  flutter_app_rebrand: ^1.0.0
```
or run this command
```bash
flutter pub add -d flutter_app_rebrand
```
Not migrated to null safety yet? use old version like this
```yaml
dev_dependencies: 
  flutter_app_rebrand: ^1.0.0
```


Update dependencies 
```
flutter pub get
```
Run this command to change the package name for both platforms.

```
dart run flutter_app_rebrand:main rebrand.json
```

where `rebrand.json` is the JSON file contains the new package name, path to the new launcher icon, and the updated app name.

## Example rebrand.json File
```
{
  "bundleId": "new.bundle.id",
  "iconPath": "/Users/PATH/TO/ICON/ic_launcher.png",
  "appName": "New App Name"
}
```
